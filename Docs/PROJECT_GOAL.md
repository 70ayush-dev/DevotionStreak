# 🕉️ Hanuman Chalisa 11×11 Challenge (PWA)
## Project Goal

Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps users complete a devotional habit:
**11 Hanuman Chalisa recitations per day for 11 consecutive days**.

### Core Outcomes
- One-tap tracking of recitations (0–11 each day)
- Clear daily + overall progress
- Streak tracking (only if day completed)
- Badges/milestones to keep motivation high
- Optional community layer (groups + leaderboard) later
- Works great on mobile, installs like an app, fast + offline-friendly

### Product Values
- Simple, respectful, non-addictive
- Motivation without guilt
- Privacy-first and opt-in community
